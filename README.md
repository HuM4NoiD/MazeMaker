# MazeMaker
A C Program to generate and solve a Maze using Depth First Traversal
Depth First Traversal Ensures a maze which is solvable, always

The program is a little inefficent in space complexity, can be improved
Feel free to contribute

Depth First traversal may be changed to Breadth First, to provide optimal path i.e. with the least number of turns
