# MazeMaker
A C Program to generate and solve a Maze using Depth First Traversal <br/>
Depth First Traversal Ensures a maze which is solvable, always <br/><br/>

The program is a little inefficent in space complexity, can be improved.<br/>
Feel free to contribute.<br/><br/>

Depth First traversal may be changed to Breadth First, to provide optimal path i.e. with the least number of turns
